# Docked

This was one of the first programs I had ever created. It is a simple document creator that takes in markdown files and pops out a pdf. It also has support for the TeX math language.

Requires [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/)

## Usage
To convert your markdown file to pdf type `python docked.py <name-of-file>`
